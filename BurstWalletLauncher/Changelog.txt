Needs more testing - 
Import Database need repos 


To Be done:
Add a components download window where you can select to download a component.
Setting to minimize to tray(?)
Add ntp check from pool.org?
limit ConsoleBuffer and save it as log
Add support to install as a service. (Needs a system wrapper+named pipes or can we use servicecontroller?)
Stuck detection. try to restart NRS (full output of every block. If no block is found within an hour a restart will occur.)
Error detection. If console sends errors. restart wallet.
More visuals when wallet i running. Like Mining info Network diff
