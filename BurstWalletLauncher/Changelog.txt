~dev edition

Known problems:
Import Database need repos 

To Be done:
Stuck detection. try to restart NRS (if no new block in 60min then try restart NRS)
Error detection. If console sends errors. restart wallet. max once every 60min
limit ConsoleBuffer and save it as log

Add support to install as a service. (Partially done! PipeServer+Pipeclient complete needs implementation in wrapper and bwl.)

Add a components download window where you can select to download a component.
Setting to minimize to tray(?)
More visuals when wallet is running. Like Mining info Network diff
