To Be done:
Add a components download window where you can select to download a component.
Setting to minimize to tray(?)
limit ConsoleBuffer and save it as log
Add support to install as a service. (Partially done! Needs a system wrapper+named pipes or can we use servicecontroller?)
Stuck detection. try to restart NRS (if no new block in 60min then try restart NRS)
Error detection. If console sends errors. restart wallet.
More visuals when wallet is running. Like Mining info Network diff
