Import Database need repos 

To Be done:
AutoIp Settings
Add firewall rules to Windows for NRS.
Add a components download window where you can select to download a component.
Setting to minimize to tray(?)

Add ntp check from pool.org?
limit ConsoleBuffer and save it as log
Add support to install as a service. (Needs a system wrapper+named pipes or can we use servicecontroller?)

Error detection. If console sends errors. restart wallet.
