To Be done:
Check that files like java and mysqld exist.
Check if maria or java is running. (if from wallet location then offer to kill it.)
check that port 8124-8126 is not used.
If maria/mysql is running but not from wallet. offer to install sql template and use Credentials
Implement more error handling.
Maybe add feature to Export SQLdb for sharing.
Maybe add feature for an automatic update function from some repository. Not whole bundle but parts.
Maybe a GUI reconfigure for NRS settings.


Notes:
Launcher will check versions for updates. it will check launcher and mainversion.
If there is a update for the main version it will
check if there is a updater.
check if updater is uptodate.
if not it will ask to update the updater.
when udated it will ask to launch it.

When all is fine the update process is like this.
If you choose to run the updater you will start the updater
If you click on update we need to shutdown the wallet. How will this be done?
