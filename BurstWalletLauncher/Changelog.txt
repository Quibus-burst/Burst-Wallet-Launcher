~dev edition

Known problems:

Beta 4
Changed download system to be consistent over everything

To Be done:
Stuck detection. try to restart NRS (if no new block in 60min then try restart NRS)
Error detection. If console sends errors. restart wallet. max once every 60min
Add support to install as a service. (Partially done! PipeServer+Pipeclient but complete needs implementation in wrapper and bwl?)
Add a components download window where you can select to download a component.
More visuals when wallet is running. Like Mining info Network diff
